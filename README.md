# ⚽ Mathematical Modeling of Fotball Projects 

This repository contains selected projects developed during my MSc in Data Science, Statistics & Decision Analysis at Stockholm University.

The projects apply data science, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques to real-world problems, with a focus on interpretability and data-driven decision-making.

## 📂 Projects

### 1️⃣ Football Player Skillset Analysis & Player Comparison
**Objective:** Analyze and quantify a football player’s skillset using event-level data, and statistically compare their performance to peers in a major international tournament (EURO 2024) to support data-driven player evaluation.

**Key techniques:**
- Event-level data analysis using StatsBomb data
- Feature selection and engineering of on-ball actions
- Statistical comparison against tournament peers
- Data visualization to support qualitative and quantitative insights

### 2️⃣ Machine Learning-Based Football Player Evaluation Metric
**Objective:** Design a novel machine learning-based metric to quantify a specific aspect of football performance, and use it to identify top-performing players across the top five European leagues to support data-driven recruitment decisions.

**Individual contribution:**

- Defined a specific aspect of play (attacking or defensive) as a machine learning problem
- Engineered input features from event-level football data
- Trained and evaluated a predictive model using Premier League data
- Ranked players based on the proposed metric and extended the analysis to other European leagues
- Communicated results through both technical and non-technical reports

**Group contribution:**

- Performed a data-driven analysis of squad needs for a Premier League team
- Compared individual player recommendations across group members
- Contributed to a joint recruitment report and final signing recommendations

**Key techniques:**
- Feature engineering on event-level football data (WyScout)
- Supervised machine learning modeling
- Player ranking and cross-league comparison
- Model evaluation and validation
- Data visualization and football-focused interpretation

### 3️⃣ Attacking Run Pattern Analysis in Elite Football
**Objective:** Analyze and quantify attacking run patterns of players during possession sequences, using tracking-derived run data from the 2023 UEFA Champions League Final.

**Key tasks:**
- Visualized all attacking runs of a selected player to identify movement tendencies
- Quantified average run direction and directional variability using a custom metric
- Interpreted movement patterns in a tactical and analytical context

**Key techniques:**
- Spatial data analysis
- Vector-based movement representation
- Custom metric design for directional consistency
- Data visualization of player movement patterns
- Football-specific interpretation and reporting
