### Machine Learning-Based Football Player Evaluation Metric
**Objective:** Design a novel machine learning-based metric to quantify a specific aspect of football performance, and use it to identify top-performing players across the top five European leagues to support data-driven recruitment decisions.

**Individual contribution:**

- Defined a specific aspect of play (attacking or defensive) as a machine learning problem
- Engineered input features from event-level football data
- Trained and evaluated a predictive model using Premier League data
- Ranked players based on the proposed metric and extended the analysis to other European leagues
- Communicated results through both technical and non-technical reports

**Group contribution:**

- Performed a data-driven analysis of squad needs for a Premier League team
- Compared individual player recommendations across group members
- Contributed to a joint recruitment report and final signing recommendations

**Key techniques:**
- Feature engineering on event-level football data (StatsBomb)
- Supervised machine learning modeling
- Player ranking and cross-league comparison
- Model evaluation and validation
- Data visualization and football-focused interpretation

## Data
This project uses proprietary football event and tracking-derived data (e.g. Wyscout / similar provider) to analyze player performance and movement patterns.

Due to data licensing and usage restrictions, the raw data cannot be shared publicly in this repository. The analysis focuses on demonstrating the methodology, feature engineering, and analytical approach rather than data distribution.
